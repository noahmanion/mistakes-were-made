    &lt;h1 id=&quot;my-journey&quot;&gt;My Journey&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight I was riding my bicycle home late for the second night in a row. Last night, I was riding home from eating an amazing dinner at one of the most amazing restaurants in the city thanks to one of the partners at my job. Tonight I was riding home after giving a talk hosted by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startupinstitute.com&quot;&gt;Startup Institute&lt;/a&gt; about how to break into the Digital Marketing scene in Chicago. After the talk I checked my email to see a note from a community manager at Unbounce was impressed with some Javascript I posted on their community forum. Both nights I was riding a 1978 Gitane Track Bike and wearing a ReLoad messenger backpack. I got the bike and bag five years ago when I was a bike messenger. My professional life was directionless and I was pretty unhappy. I would have never imagined that I’d be riding my work bike, wearing my work bag and be (somewhat) successful at what I was doing.
###Where I started
In 2009 I had a full-time job in City Planning that was kind of a dead end and I wasn’t very happy. A friend offered me a shift working at his messenger company and I eventually picked up a few shifts a week to suppliment my income. I loved riding my bike and being outside. Being a bike messenger can actually be a pretty though job. It requires expert multi-tasking skills, people skills and hustle. It’s something you’re either good at or you aren’t and there’s no rhyme or reason about who’s good at it and who isn’t. 
Eventually I realized that I can’t ride my bike around for work and have a full-time “professional” job. At the time I was working on doing marketing and user analysis a pretty neat piece of software, but my wife and I decided to move to Chicago. I knew this was my chance to make a change in my career.
###Chicago
We arrived in Chicago at the end of Summer 2013. I took a few weeks to get my bearings and started to apply for work. I tried the Planning &amp;amp; Enineering sector, but eventually realized that I didn’t want to work in that industry anymore. I floated for a few weeks and met a few people. I came across the Startup Institute and filled out half of the application. A few weeks later I got an email asking me why I didn’t submit my application. I finished it and had an interview a few days later. I did the homework assignement and was eventually accepted. 
My SI cohort started on March 1, 2014 and my professional life turned a corner.
###Startup Institute &amp;amp; My First Job
I won’t go into detail about the course, there are people who can tell better stories about that than I can. I made some excellent connections and the most valuable thing I got out of the program was a Network. I freelanced for a few months and finally got a pretty neat job at a data driven consumer company. I learned a whole lot about paid placements, worked to overcome a few things that I’m not so strong on and came up with a pretty neat idea to help grow the paid acqusition channel. 
###Where I Am Now
I received a really compelling offer from my current company in August 2015 and switched jobs. I’m working on more than paid placements, I’m working on a whole growth process for a couple of great clients making thoughtful and intersting products. It’s been an incredible journey and I couldn’t have imagined how my professional life would have changed and I coudn’t be happier about the way it turned out.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h1 id=&quot;advertise-products-online-and-have-problems-when-things-are-out-of-stock&quot;&gt;Advertise products online and have problems when things are out of stock?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a problem where I was running product ads on a variety of platforms, but things would go out of stock and my application wasn’t able to automatically turn ads off. I figured out a way to use Adwords Scripts &amp;amp; the Twilio API to notify me of these changes! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The problem:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was working on a project where I was advertising products that had limited quantities that I wasn’t aware of, and multiple referral sources bringing traffic to the product page. In addition, the action I was tracking to use as a conersion wasn’t necessarily a purchase, pageview or outbound click. Couple that with a conversion tracking system that wans’t always accurate and I had a real issue on my hands.
For the first few months of the project, I just sent traffic to the product lisitng page and waited until someone watching the page notified me that the product was no longer available. This worked out for awhile until there was a miscommunication and I ended up paying several thousand dollars to send traffic to an inactive page. 
I had been looking into AdWords Scripts for awhile to automate some AdWords work I was doing and I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freeadwordsscripts.com&quot;&gt;FreeAdwordsScripts.com&lt;/a&gt; and began to explore how some of the example scripts there could help. I learned how to connect a script to a Google Sheet and extract infromation, and I found the most helpful example &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freeadwordsscripts.com/2014/01/make-calls-and-send-text-messages-to.html&quot;&gt;how to connect the Twilio API&lt;/a&gt; to your Scripts account, thus allowing you automate text messages reporiting anomalies with your account (or in my case, pages I was tracking).
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wMtmhR7um578l4HWVf-PSa0e1KLoR-5u8khbxj1CVLg/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Here’s a spreadsheet to copy&lt;/a&gt;. The sheet uses the named range in the sheet to run. If you only need to track one URL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;heres-the-full-code&quot;&gt;Here’s the full code:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```javascript
/&lt;strong&gt;**&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*
&lt;em&gt;Out of Stock Checker Script v2.3
*
*
*2.3 changes: Added Twilio capibility to send texts when there is a problem with a URL
**&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;//variables needed for teh script
var spreadsheet_url = “SPREADSHEET_URL_HERE”;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;var TEXT_CHANGED = “Whatever you’re looking to track”;
var subject = “URL CHANGE!”;
var recipient = “you@example.com”;
var results = “There was a change at: “;
var sid = ‘GET_YOUR_OWN’;
var auth = ‘FROM_TWILIO’;
var client = new Twilio(sid,auth);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;function main() {
	//put a spreadsheet range into an array
	var iter = buildSelector();
	for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; iter.length; i++) {
		//iterate through the range to create urls to fetch
		var page = iter[i];
		//get the source of an item in the array
		htmlCode = UrlFetchApp.fetch(page).getContentText();
		//check the source for text
		if (htmlCode.indexOf(TEXT_CHANGED) &amp;gt;= 0) {
			//send an email if changed
			MailApp.sendEmail(recipient, subject, results+entity);
			//send a text if changed, the first number is where the text should go, the second is where it should come from
			client.sendMessage(‘+1234567890’,’+9876543210’,”This Page Has Changed: “+page)
        	//log the expired urls. mostly here as a debugger
        	Logger.log(“this is page doesn’t exist like it should: “+page);
		} else {
			//log the good urls. mostly here as a debugger
			Logger.log(page+” is good”)
		}
	} 
}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;function buildSelector () {
	var spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.openByUrl(spreadsheet_url);
	var sheet = spreadsheet.getRangeByName(‘URLS_TO_TRACK’);
	var selector = new Array();
	var sheet_values = sheet.getValues();
	for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; sheet_values.length; i++) {

			//continue
