I don't have a ton of projects, but I'm most interested in Javascript, Ruby & Rails.
I've been working on the [railsbridge](http://railsbridge.org) curriculum to get better with Javascript. The most recent thing I built was this [Javascript To-Do App](https://noahmanion.github.io/js-todo). My plans are to build my own backend for it.
