## Managing Large Ad Spends
I got my start in digital marketing doing search and social ads. After spending several months doing freelance work, I started at Brad's Deals initially managing a $50k/mo search ad budget. After several months I took over paid social as well. During Q4 the budget could go well over $1MM/mo. At Brad's deals I became very passionate about attribution and cohort payback. I helped to optimize a system where bids & budget were set based on the performance of previous cohorts and the performance of users acquired through specific targeting. 

## Optimizing Acqusition Process for Revenue

In addtion to being very data concious for bidding and budget, I helped make a few improvments to the acqusition process to begin to add incrimental revenue and reduce banner blindness. Originally, all ads linked to a landing page containig only a call to action and email sign up form. There weren't any examples of deals or products avialable visible on the landing page. We experimented with showing a partial screen modal on top of specific product pages to both show the user which products were avialable and to encourage first-visit purchases. Through iterative testing, we found that this lead gen process was improved over the previous process. 

I also helped improve our ad creative to both reduce banner blindness and encourage purchases. We experimented with two different ad creatives. The first was a more general value propisition aroung saving money on products. The second was one where the value proposition was to showcase great deals on specific products. Because we were able to advertise specific products, we were able to both encourage sales and to get the attention of potential subscribers. We found that we were able to improve the CTR on paid social ads and use post interaction to leverage Facebook's algorithm to show our ads to more people. 

## Landing Page Tests

I've worked with clients for more than 5 years to build and optimize landing pages. In my experience, there are always signifcant gains to be made by testing calls to action, form strucure and unique selling propsitions. Improving the landing page experience and efficiency can lead to huge gains in Cost Per Lead. I worked with a luxury homegood company to generate pre-sales for a line of product they were launching. They had been running an extended product-market fit test while their items were in production. I sent some Facebook traffic to the page and returned leads for about $20 per lead. With a retail price of $175 for their product, this obviously wasn't sustainable. By rapidly testing landing page structure, calls to action and form fields, I was able to reduct CPL to less than $3.

## Setting Up Growth Programs

I have extensive experience setting up growth process. The majority of my work with Digital Intent involved planning, building and growing new products. Because of this I was able to set up a system of growth process to create a backlog of growth marketing activities, prioritizing the backlog and executing on that backlog. Growth isn't about individual "hacks", but instead about a process of testing, iteration and learning. You'll oftentimes read about single ideas that changed the trajectory of a product, but what you don't often read about is what activties led to the creation of those ideas (though you definitely should)

I feel that the best way I stay focused on growth is to work in sprints, beginning the sprint with a meeting to regroup on the activities of the last sprint and the plan the activities of the next sprint. Of course, knowing where to go next is a lot easier with an extensive knowledge of where you've been in the past. Thus, I'm a huge proponent of keeping a log of activities and measuring improvement for your activites (keeping in mind that not every activity will show an improvement). I've used software built for growth management like [Growth Hackers Projects](https://projects.growthhackers.com/) and I've used Airtable to keep a log of growth activites. It doesn't necessarily matter what you use to track, but that you're tracking the impact of activities somewhere.  

## Product Market Fit

Understanding if there's a market for a product is key to growth process and is typically the first step to building a successful product. The easiest way to figure out if there's a market for a product is to publish a landing page and offer something for sale, even if there is no product available yet. If you send traffic to that page and there are people that demonstrate interest, then that's a pretty strong signal that a product is worth building. 

I have some pretty extensive experience with this. A company came to Digital Intent to build a mobile device insurance product, however before they committed to building a full product, they wanted to make sure there was demand for what they were building. We built a very rough verion of the planned app and sent traffic to this version. Users would select their plan and complete the regsiration process. When it came time to click a buy button, they were shown a message saying that the product wasn't quite ready for launch. I did several varants of the landing page to not only figure out if there was a market for specific areas of the product, but to also test marketing messaging in order to start to figure out the unique selling propositions. 

## Uncovering Insights Using Data

Data and analysis has been part of my work since I was working in Transportation Planning. It's how I learned about marketing and it's a skill I've leveraged in every position I've had since I began working. I'm willing and capable of using SQL to query a database. In fact, I think one of the best ways to get a handle on performance is to query a database and build a reporting dashboard. Through exploring data I've uncovered fraud and figured which users are the most valuable to acquire. 

## Optimzing Referral Programs

In 2018, I worked with two different clients on improving their referral programs. The two clients had the same problem in that their referral programs weren't particularly successful however the reasons for this couldn't be more different. One had a referral program that was bringing in a lot of users, however the users that were being acquired weren't contributing revenue to pay for the referral bonuses. The other client had a referral program, that simply wasn't bringing in users. For the first company, we experimented with varying the amount and eventually settled on giving a specific reward instead of account credit. 

The second company required a little bit more work. When examining traffic on referral links we realized that the majority of existing traffic was coming from Facebook. In order to optimize that traffic we looked what what we had control over to optimize. Since Facebook had stopped allowing apps to create the text for posts with a share button, we optimized the Open Graph  tags on the referral links. The most impressive portion was we created custom open graph images for each user that conatined referral code test overlayed right on the image. At the same time, we needed to increase traffic to the referral screen in app. 

We tested emails with share buttons built right in and those provided a small bump. The biggest gains came from extensively testing the referral reward amounts. Since our referral program was two sided, we tested both the referent and referrer rewards. What we learned was that the referent amount didn't seem to make much of a impact in referral success, but the referrer reward was hugely important. We also learned that allowing users to easily check the status of their referrals was very important to users.
