* By day I have a job in growth and marketing.
* By night (and occasionally by day) I try to teach myself how to develop things for the internet
	* I've modified a pretty cool twitter bot using node.js
	* I've also figured out a way to use AdWords scripts to keep an eye on ad campaigns I run for work.
* I really like stats. I think this is why I've become a sports fan as of late. I'm mostly into hockey, but I have a-bit-more-than a passing interst in Football & Baseball (pro only).
* I'm also really into food, specifically pickles and controlled spoilage.
