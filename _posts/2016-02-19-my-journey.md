#My Journey
Tonight I was riding my bicycle home late for the second night in a row. Last night, I was riding home from eating an amazing dinner at one of the most amazing restaurants in the city thanks to one of the partners at my job. Tonight I was riding home after giving a talk hosted by the [Startup Institute](https://www.startupinstitute.com) about how to break into the Digital Marketing scene in Chicago. After the talk I checked my email to see a note from a community manager at Unbounce was impressed with some Javascript I posted on their community forum. Both nights I was riding a 1978 Gitane Track Bike and wearing a ReLoad messenger backpack. I got the bike and bag five years ago when I was a bike messenger. My professional life was directionless and I was pretty unhappy. I would have never imagined that I'd be riding my work bike, wearing my work bag and be (somewhat) successful at what I was doing.
###Where I started
In 2009 I had a full-time job in City Planning that was kind of a dead end and I wasn't very happy. A friend offered me a shift working at his messenger company and I eventually picked up a few shifts a week to suppliment my income. I loved riding my bike and being outside. Being a bike messenger can actually be a pretty though job. It requires expert multi-tasking skills, people skills and hustle. It's something you're either good at or you aren't and there's no rhyme or reason about who's good at it and who isn't. 
Eventually I realized that I can't ride my bike around for work and have a full-time "professional" job. At the time I was working on doing marketing and user analysis a pretty neat piece of software, but my wife and I decided to move to Chicago. I knew this was my chance to make a change in my career.
###Chicago
We arrived in Chicago at the end of Summer 2013. I took a few weeks to get my bearings and started to apply for work. I tried the Planning & Enineering sector, but eventually realized that I didn't want to work in that industry anymore. I floated for a few weeks and met a few people. I came across the Startup Institute and filled out half of the application. A few weeks later I got an email asking me why I didn't submit my application. I finished it and had an interview a few days later. I did the homework assignement and was eventually accepted. 
My SI cohort started on March 1, 2014 and my professional life turned a corner.
###Startup Institute & My First Job
I won't go into detail about the course, there are people who can tell better stories about that than I can. I made some excellent connections and the most valuable thing I got out of the program was a Network. I freelanced for a few months and finally got a pretty neat job at a data driven consumer company. I learned a whole lot about paid placements, worked to overcome a few things that I'm not so strong on and came up with a pretty neat idea to help grow the paid acqusition channel. 
###Where I Am Now
I received a really compelling offer from my current company in August 2015 and switched jobs. I'm working on more than paid placements, I'm working on a whole growth process for a couple of great clients making thoughtful and intersting products. It's been an incredible journey and I couldn't have imagined how my professional life would have changed and I coudn't be happier about the way it turned out.
