subtitle: A Quiz I Created for Eat Purely Acqusition
---

Between 2017 and 2018, I worked with a company that Founder Equity made an investment in. [Eat Purely](https://eatpurely.com) makes and delivers healthy, chef made meals to customers in about 20 minutes. Meals are ordered via a mobile app. Eat Purely's target customer is someone who is interested in healthy food, but may not have the time to cook for themselves or their family. I spent a lot of time focused on how to acquire customers efficiently, but found that trying to get users to download a mobile app and then getting them to first sign up and then make a purchase on that app wasn't really working because we didn't get contact information until the user registered on te app.

Eventually I thought that it might be better to use a lead gen model in order to get contact information for users that convereted. The model I used was to direct ads to a landing page and when a user would complete the form on the landing page, they would be directed to the Eat Purely registration form with fields they completed on the ladning page were pre-filled. I was always on the lookout for interesting ways to acquire leads and was served an ad from Blue Apron. The ad led to a landing page that featured a quiz of trivia question about the ingredients of Blue Apron boxes. 

It was neat to see how they educated about the ingredients and had targeted an audience that had an interest in food. I was fascinated by the strategy and wanted to do something similar. After viewing the page source, I realized it was a simple quiz built with JavaScript and that I could probably create someting similar. After finding several examples on CodePen, I heavily modified the quiz to mirror what Blue Apron had been using to create a prototype. The prototype I created is [available here.](https://noahs.website/quizengine).
