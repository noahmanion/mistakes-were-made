## My History

I have a BA in Liberal Arts from the Eugene Lang College (at the New School University). During college, I worked as a transportation planner. I worked on a web app to match commuters into carpools called [511NY Rideshare](https://www.511nyrideshare.org). I worked on the project from the vendor selection phase to product planning and included a phase where several legacy systems were combined into the new system. My job entailed doing some marketing and product analysis and reporting work. It was during this time that I developed an interest in Digital Products & Marketing. 

In 2013, I relocated to Chicago. After moving to Chicago, I attended the Startup Institute in the Spring of 2014. I learned all aspects of digital marketing including SEO, SEM, Content Planning & Production, Paid & Organic Social, CRM, Email & Conversion Optimization. I worked with a local company to plan & market their app that seeks to digitize the lost & found systems at large public spaces & festivals. After completing the Startup Institute's program I did some contract work with several local companies, mostly around setting up paid search programs. 

At the end of the summer of 2014, I took an SEM Specialist position at [Brad's Deals](https://www.bradsdeals.com). I worked mostly on search and Facebook advertising. I managed budget of between $750,000 and $1,000,000 per month. I experimented with two changes to the lead gen process at Brad's Deals: First, I worked with the product team to modify the lead gen landing page from a simple page with a form to being able to fire a lightbox modal when a paged load so the user could see the discounted products that Brad's Deals was advertisitng. Second, I modified the ad creative to show specific deals on products to help increase CTR and CVR. 

In 2015, I took a position at [Digital Intent](https://www.digintent.com), a digital innovation studio headquartered in Chicago. In my positon as Growth Manager I worked with several clients to figure out product market fit, set up growth marketing process and acquire initial users. I spent nearly all of my time at Digital Intent working on an app called [S'more](https://smoreapp.co) that allows Android users to "rent" their lock screen to S'more which shows ads. In exchange, S'more rewards users with points that can be redeemed for gift cards. I was involved with S'more from the planning stages through launch and product maturity. I started when S'more had 0 users and when I left Digital Intent, S'more had nearly 80,000 DAUs. I touched all portions of the product from paid acqusitions to managing communications to reducing user churn to planning and optimizing a referral program. 

Additionally, I worked to plan and prepare [Lori](http://trylori.com/), a mobile device insurance platform using a conversational UI. I did several pre-launch smoke tests to gauge user insights & plan features and created a marketing plan for year one, post launch.  Some of other the clients I worked with include a luxury homegoods manfacturuer looking for pre-sale marketing, an accounting frim interested in building up a digial marketing proficiency and a craft box subscription company looking for initial customers.

In addition, Digital Intent has a venture capital fund that provides seed stage investments. [Founder Equity](https://founderequity.fund) invests both cash and serivces in companes. The services come in the form of time from the Digital Intent team. I spent time on two companies: Sunrise Safety, a digital safety records managment platform needed assistance in positioning and creating a content marketing apparatus. I also spent a lot of time with [Eat Purely](http://www.eatpurely.com) filling in during periods of trasnition on the marketing team. I managed acqusition efforts and spent a lot of time reviewing and analyzing the performance of a referral program. 

Seeking to advance my career, in 2019 I became Director of Growth at [LandscapeHub](https://www.landscapehub.com), an online markeplace for the landscape industry. With LandscapeHub, businesses who buy landscape materials can search plants, view availablity, build job quotes and purchase materials online. Suppliers are able to easily list accurate inventories and acquire new customers. As Director of Growth I set up a system to track & report on business metrics and growth process pritotization & tracking. I also acquired users through paid placements, moved our CRM activities from MailChimp to HubSpot and worked with product & development teams to build & A/B test features to improve activation. While at LandscapeHub, I was able to triple the conversion rate on landing pages and improve efficiencny of converting landing page leads into users by funneling landing page leads to a pre-filled registration page. Unfortunately, the indsutry may not have been ready for an online procurement solution and I was laid off in October 2019.
